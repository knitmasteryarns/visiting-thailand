          <p>One of the best things about traveling is trying new foods. Thailand has a diverse food culture influenced by the cuisines of nearby Southeast Asian countries like Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos, Indonesia and Mayalsia, 
          but also by Chinese and Indian dishes. There is a wide variety of dishes to try, ranging from mild like pad thai to the spicest tom yum kun you can imagine. 
          Curries, satay, spring rolls, papaya salad are other popular options.</p> 
          <p>If you are interested in taking the tastes of Thailand home with you, check out some of the cooking classes that are available in whatever area you're staying in.</p>

          <h3>Festivals</h3>
          <p>November is the perfect time to visit Northern Thailand, more specially Chiang Mai, because of two popular festivals that are held, Yi Peng and Loi Krathong. 
          Although Loy Krathong is celebrated throughout Thailand, it is especially popular in Chaing Mai. Krathongs are floats decorated with colourful flowers, leaves and candles that are may also contain small sweets 
          or a coin as an offering for the water spirits. Revelers release their krathong into the river and make a wish for the future. 
          The date of Loi Krathong changes from year to year since it is based on the Thai lunar calendar, but it is usually held in mid to late November in the Western calendar.</p>
          <p>Yi Peng, or the Lantern Festival, coincides with Loi Kranthong, making November an excellent time to visit Chaing Mai. During this festival, thousands of floating paper lanterns are released into the sky as part of a Buddhist practice. 
          The lanterns contain small candles or lights and look just like constellations of stars in the sky. Although they are a sight to behold, these festivals are not without their problems. The lanterns in particular are hazardous to passing 
          aircrafts and the Thai government places restrictions on their use in certain areas.</p>

          <h3>Shopping</h3>
          <p>Bangkok has world-class shopping ranging from modern global brands to havens for bargain hunters. It is relatively easy to navigate the Skytrain (BTS) system in the city, making it easy to visit several shopping centers in one day. 
          It is better to stick to the Skytrain than to risk being taken on a wild goose chase in a tuk-tuk, as fun as they look.</p>
          <p>Shopping outside the city offers a plethora of goods from silk, pottery, antiques, cosmetics, jewellery, handicrafts, home decor and snacks, making it a shopper's paradise.</p>
